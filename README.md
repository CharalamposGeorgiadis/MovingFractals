# MovingFractals
C app using OpenGL that draws a fractal made out of 10000 points that form a pentagon inspired by Sierpinski's triangle.
The fractal can be moved by left-clicking ad draggin the mouse on the window.
There are 5 menu options:
The first one creates a pentagon made out of 8000 points.
The second one creates a pentagon made out of 10000 points, where each points has a different random color.
The third one determines that the fractal will be a pentagon.
The fourth one determines that the fractal will be a pentagon.
The third one shuts down the application.
Every time the app draws a fractal with a different number of points, the fractal changes to a random color.
The app uses double buffering.

NOTE: If using Microsoft Visual Studio make sure that the Active solution platform is x86 (Build -> Configuration Manager).
